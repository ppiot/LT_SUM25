# When Light Strikes Copper: Unleashing Bright Ultra-fast Electron Bunches
Lee-Teng intern project -- Summer 2025

## Abstract

In June 2025, a significant upgrade to the Advanced Photon Source (APS) will unfold with the installation of a state-of-the-art ultrafast laser system. This enhancement will power a new era of bright electron generation via photoemission, enabling the production and injection of high-brightness and high-charge electron bunches into the APS complex.

This research project centers on the characterization of the new laser system—expected to produce pulses on the order of 100 femtoseconds—and its interaction with a copper photocathode. Key goals include:

- Measuring pulse duration, transverse beam size, and overall beam quality.
- Investigating the dependence of photoemission properties on laser pulse parameters.
- Optimizing conditions for maximum brightness and charge extraction.

At the crossroads of ultrafast optics, quantum mechanics, and classical electrodynamics, this hands-on project presents a rare opportunity to bridge theory and practice. Participants will:

- Conduct experiments in a state-of-the-art laboratory setting.
- Develop and apply Python-based tools for data acquisition, analysis, and automation.
- Contribute to the foundational understanding necessary for future upgrades of the APS injection system.

The outcomes of this work will not only advance the performance of the APS but also build critical skills in experimental physics, scientific computing, and accelerator technology.
